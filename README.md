### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Paolo Bosetti, professor at the [Department of Industrial Engineering of the University of Trento](https://dii.unitn.it).

I teach Precision Engineering, Digital Manufacturing and Statistical Methods for Measurements.

I do research mostly in the same fields, with a focus on applications to manufacturing processes. See [my publications](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=Ib1JKOEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

Tools/languages I am using, mostly on MacOS or Ubuntu Linux:

- C
- C++
- Lua
- Ruby
- R and RStudio
- Matlab
- Docker
- CMake
- VSCode
- Multipass
- MongoDB
- ZeroMQ
- MQTT and Mosquitto
- TensorRT, TensorFlow Lite on NVIDIS TX2/nano

If you are interested in cross-compilation for ARM devices, have a look at my [Xtemplate](https://github.com/pbosetti/xtemplate).

If you are interested in finite state machines, get to know my [Graphviz to C code generator](https://github.com/pbosetti/gv_fsm).

I am still despising Python.
